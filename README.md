Title:Update css variable using JS


## screen shot




## 🍾 Description of project 💣


1. The project aims to create a webpage where users can dynamically update CSS variables using JavaScript. Specifically, users can adjust parameters such as spacing, blur, and base color through input controls.
2. The webpage includes a set of interactive UI elements, including range inputs for spacing and blur, a color input for base color selection, and an image displaying the effects of the CSS variable changes.
3. The project incorporates responsive design principles using a media query for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels. In smaller screens, adjustments are made to the spacing variable and body font size for a better user experience.
4. The CSS file defines root-level variables for base color, spacing, and blur. These variables are dynamically updated using JavaScript based on user input. The styling includes a visually appealing layout for the webpage, with a background image, text alignment, and color scheme.
5. JavaScript handles user interactions by adding event listeners to the input elements. When a user changes the input values, the handleUpdate function is triggered, updating the CSS variables and applying the changes to the styling of the webpage in real-time.
